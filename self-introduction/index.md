Hello fellos, my name is Leonid. I am a 26-year-old young man located in the beautiful country of Belarus, 
and I aspire to join the IT field as a Frontend Developer. Unfortunately, I currently do not hold any significant role in IT,
but I aim to change that really soon.

Previously, I completed my education at GSAU (Grodno State Agrarian University),
where i finish faculty of Veterinary Medicine. I then worked for a few years on a farm where i work like veterian doctor.
I only taking a break for compulsory military service in the border troops its not the best time to spend but I serve in the most beatiful part of my countru in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, which left an indelible impression.

However, I realized that I couldn't progress beyond the role of farm chairman.
Therefore, I made a strong-willed decision to change my profession to something more promising and well-paid.
Where i can show my true potential.

I completed my work practice at the farm and began my education last summer at RS-School courses.
From my perspective, I have learned and understood many useful technologies, starting from HTML and CSS and progressing to current RS-School program technologies like Classes and Object-oriented programming.Previously i dont undestod how curectly use Class and all my project consisted of function programing but at next project i will try to realize in Object-oriented programming. During my education, I also improved my English proficiency to A2 level.

I felt a real excitement during learning node.js, which showed me how easily I can combine both Frontend and Backend, 
which gave me an idea to learn Node deeply and become a Fullstack developer in future

During the course, I found the most enjoyment in developing the project Nonograms. 
In this project, I encountered various logic challenges and faced the most problems with Webpack, 
which helped me understand its features and aided in my personal growth.
Also when i make my second big project Coffee House I used the Webpack first time and I really enjoyed,
I have had a real pleasure making a beatiful structure of project where all elements of project are interconnected and properly decomposed.

In the future, I aspire to learn how to use Angular and further enhance my skills in FullStack Development.
It is All thanks for your watching.
