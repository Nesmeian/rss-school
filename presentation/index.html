            <h2>React</h2>
            <p>
              It is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
              for creating user interfaces. It allows us to assemble a complex
              UI from small isolated pieces of code called "components".

            <h2>React was developed by Facebook in March 2013</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              React was created to solve the problem of efficiently updating the
              user interface in real-time without requiring the entire page to
              be reloaded.
            </aside>
            <aside class="notes">
              The history of React development is quite extensive, so let's
              focus on it for a moment.

            <h3>React 0.14(2015)</h3>
            In this version, stateless components were added, making the code
            more declarative and testing easier.
            <aside class="notes">
              A stateless component, also known as a functional component, is a
              fundamental concept in React that represents a UI element without
              any internal state management. In simpler terms, a stateless
              component is a function that takes props as input and returns JSX
              (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.

          <section>
            <h3>React 0.3 (2013)</h3>
            The first release of React introduced basic concepts such as the
            virtual DOM and unidirectional data flow. These principles ensured
            that the interface was effectively updated without the need for a
            complete page re-rendering.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>React 16.0 (2017)</h3>
            The emergence of Fiber, a new architecture of the React internal
            device.
            <aside class="notes">
              Fiber's goal is to increase productivity when developing tasks
              such as animation, organizing elements on a page, and moving
              elements. Its main feature is incremental rendering: the ability
              to divide the rendering work into units and distribute them among
              multiple frames.

            <h3>React 16.3 (2018)</h3>
            Context has been added, and the lifecycle system has been improved.
            <aside class="notes">
              Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree
              without having to pass props down manually at every level.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>React 16.8(2019)</h3>
            Hooks were added - functional components providing access to state
            and the possibility of using lifecycle methods.
            <aside class="notes">
              Hooks allow using states and other features of React without using
              classes.

          <section>
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Quick because it uses Virtual DOM</li>
              <li>A huge number of open libraries</li>
              <li>One-Way Binding</li>
              <li>React Native</li>
              <li>Advanced and most useful React Dev tools</li>
              <li>Has a low entry threshold</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>VDOM</h2>
            The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or
            “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with
            the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called
            reconciliation.
            <aside class="notes">
              In simple terms, VDOM compares its nodes and nodes of the DOM; if
              something is different, then it redoes only these nodes and
              doesn't touch the entire tree. This is faster than manipulation
              with DOM.
            </aside>

          <section>
            <h2>A huge number of open libraries</h2>
            A large number of libraries have been developed for React, which
            allow you to work without problems even with very complex
            animations, and not only with it.
            <aside class="notes">
              Examples include Formik, React Popper, React animations, React
              Icons.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>One-Way Binding</h3>
            One-way binding means that the binding happens in one direction. In
            this case, changes in the data automatically update the UI, but
            changes in the UI do not automatically update the data. That’s why
            it is referred to as one-way data binding.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>React Native</h3>
            React Native is a popular JavaScript-based mobile application
            platform that allows creating native mobile applications for iOS and
            Android. Also, this framework allows creating applications for
            different platforms using the same code base.

          <section>
            <h3>React Dev Instruments</h3>
            These tools help coding smoothly and easier.
            <aside class="notes">
              Examples include React Datasheet, which allows using math
              formulas, React Native for Web, which adds progress bars, buttons,
              and a lot of useful things, Reactide, which is an IDE tool for
              working with React, among others.
            </aside>

          <section>
            <h2>has a low entry threshold</h2>
            compared to other frameworks and libraries, React is relatively easy
            to use, but it takes a long time to master it.
          </section>

            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              There are not many of them, but they are worth mentioning.
            </aside>
            <ul>
              <li>Doesn't work out of the box</li>
              <li>There is no division into modules</li>
